<b>Abstract:</b>\
Histologic analyses of glomeruli in renal tissues
yield a substantial amount of information about
overall health and conditions or diseases stemming from glomerular structural damage. Current medical practices of standard glomeruli assessment are completed through a manual evaluation of the quantification of normal and abnormal glomeruli in kidney biopsies, which
are laborious, costly, and function with high
degrees of error from missed or misclassified
glomeruli. Moreover, the input of an in-house
trained nephropathologist is needed for a kidney
biopsy analysis — labor that is not readily available at medical centers. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop deep learning framework to fully automatically segment glomeruli, incorporating a novel energy-based model inspired
by Helmholtz’ Free Energy to compute prediction uncertainty. Because our energy approach is
theoretically aligned with the probability density
of inputs, we demonstrate both empirically and
mathematically that our energy-based model outperforms the traditional softmax confidence score
in our settings. Our framework was trained on
data provided by HuBMAP and AIDPATH and
achieved a validation F1-score of 94.7% on an unseen dataset. These results were shown to perform
significantly better than previously related works.
Overall, our approach to segment glomeruli with
a confidence score maximizes the efficiency of
nephropathologists with a drastically expedited
process of extracting glomerular features from
large histopathological images
